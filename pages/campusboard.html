			<div class="page_content_container"><p>Most of my current fitness goals revolve around bodyweight movement, and specifically involving the muscle groups that rock climbing recruits. I wanted a better way to train pullups then weighted exercise, so I built a ladder in my backyard, off an old skiing structure that I constructed in 2009. I soon realized that it would be a fair bit smarter to also train my forearms while I "campused" (climbing something with just your arms) so I rebuilt the campus ladder, into a campus board. The board only allows your fingers to engage the rungs, so you recruit more muscle while exercising. <br>
			My local climbing gym has a campus board, but I don't always have a membership there, and I like being able to train throughout the day, as opposed to in dedicated training sessions, so building one in my backyard was the clear step forward.</p>
