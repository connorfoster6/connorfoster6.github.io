				<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Campus; verb; The act of climbing something using only the arms.</span><br>
				<br>
				I started rock climbing &#40bouldering specifically&#41 in 2015 since I thoroughly enjoyed the activity, and noticed that it ties into many of my fitness goals.
				I wanted to be able to train the muscle groups involved in bouldering, in an optimized training environment, without having to go to the climbing gym, or pay for access to their training center.
				Having training tools at home is something I favour, for two reasons.
				When you can train at home, you aren't confined to dedicating an hour or two out of your day to exercise, so your schedule has a higher degree of freedom.
				Since you have the option to train throughout the day, instead of in dedicated sessions, you can fully recover between exercises, which means you can train harder on every set.
				I decided then, to build a campus board in my yard.
				Often in bouldering, you encounter moves which require lots of strength, but not in an optimized training environment.
				The bouldering environment trains strength as a function of climbing, whereas the campus board trains strength as a function of itself.
				The purpose of a campus board generally, is to train upper body strength to very high degree, using small boards &#40often as thin as half of an inch&#41 screwed into a face of plywood.
				<br>

				<br>
				I had built a structure for skiing back in 2009 that was perfect to mount the board onto.
				For someone who has strength goals, as well as climbing goals, training on a campus board is the obvious step forward, and an environment that allows you to immerse yourself is key to adaption.<br>
