				Rock climbing &#40bouldering specifically&#41 ties into many of my fitness goals, and I wanted to be able to train the muscle groups involved in bouldering without having to go to a gym and pay for a membership. There is freedom in being able to exercise at any instant, so I decided to build a campus ladder in my backyard. I built a structure for skiing back in 2009 that was perfect to mount the ladder onto. After a year of use, I had some materials laying around and wanted to upgrade it into a real campus board.<br>

				<br>
				The purpose of a campus board generally, is to train upper body strength to very high degree, using small boards &#40often as thin as half of an inch&#41 screwed into a face of plywood. Often in bouldering, you encounter moves which require lots of strength, but not in an optimized training environment. The bouldering environment trains strength as a function of climbing, whereas the campus board trains strength as a function of itself. For someone who has strength goals, as well as climbing goals, training on a campus board is the obvious step forward, and an environment that allows you to immerse yourself is key to adaption.<br>
