I started this website to do that, but I didn’t want to buy a cookie cutter website, or follow the same trends that everyone else is. Building something from scratch, and working directly in HTML allows you to create and design the website from the ground up. It shows that you fundamentally care about the process, and in the end the user interaction is almost more important than the website itself. I could write about how I did all these different projects and what I learned, but the fact is that it’s there, and it’s done, and that should tell you everything you need to know. You are your work, just as much as your work is you. This website serves as an honest window into why I do what I do, and is in and of itself a developing portfolio piece.</p>
