				I wanted to capture what the build process looks like during a project, so I set up the camera for part of the build of my storage walls.
				I was working with good-one-side plywood, so I taped the good side to try and avoid tearing up the wood with the 29&#47;64&#34; drill bit.
				I then had to drill 113 marks, remove the tape, and quickly sand the plywood.
				The final step was to hammer in the T nuts &#40;226 in total, for two storage walls&#41;.
				The build took two days to complete, and was perhaps the most tedious build I have undertaken, though it was well worth it.
				<br>
				For the video I wanted to emphasize the nature of building something by hand, so I tried to show each task I had to do briefly, and then speed through that process.
				I had to boost the exposure on the video in order to pick up the events inside the garage, which meant blowing out the outside.
				It may not look as great in the video, and while I could have fixed it up in post, it has taught me to set up my shots better.
