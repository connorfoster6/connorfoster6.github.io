				<p>
					I have seriously owned two wallets in my life.
					The first, a traditional bifold that you put in your back pocket, I found to be cumbersome and excessive.
					The second, a front pocket card holder with moneyclip, does the job well, but I felt that it left something to be desired.
					<br>
					I wanted a wallet that was small enough to fit in my front pocket, to eliminate the necessity of removal upon taking a seat.
					I primarily carry cards, however I like to keep some banknotes on me just in case.
					<br>
					I like having my cards at hand, and I don't care whether people see them.
					Since my wallet lives in my pocket, there's not much of a security risk.
					I also don't like having to fumble with my wallet to get what I need out of it.
					Once the wallet is out of my pocket, there should be no additional steps to access the primary items.
					<br>
					I needed to create a design that allowed me to carry my high use cards, with individual access for as many as possible, in a small package.
					Since banknotes are a secondary item, I allowed them to be less accessible in the design.
					<br>
					The result is a front pocket wallet, with four card access accross both faces, and a money clip in between to create a banknote sandwich.
