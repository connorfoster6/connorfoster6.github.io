			<div class="page_content_container"><p>When I listen to music, I choose very specific artists and songs to listen to at any given moment, I never hit the shuffle button, and if I do I skip most of the music, because it doesn't reflect my current state of mind. I tried making playlists, but it's an impossible task to try and define those different state of minds, you would never come close, especially since different artists are on or off trend for you. What I wanted to do was try and write an algorithm that constantly learns what you are listening to, and intelligently offer you music based on connections. The goal is a shuffle algorithm that doesn't fall into traps of playing the same music, but picks up on what sort of state of mind you're in at any given time.</p>
