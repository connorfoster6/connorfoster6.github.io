					<span style="font-style: italic;">Urban Skiing; verb; The act of using elements of an urban area such as handrails, walls, and elevation changes, for freestyle skiing.</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					In 2014 when I started skiing urban with my friends, we were limited by how much speed we could attain for a feature.
					How do you get enough speed for a feature when you're on flat ground?
					We initially had a bungee, which worked great, howvever the top speed was limited, particularly by how far you could expand the bungee.
					This was especially difficult on snow and ice, while wearing ski and snowboard boots.
					Many people were using high speed motorized winches for urban skiing, but many of these were custom made, and hard to get a hold of, not to mention how much they cost.
					<br>
					I was taking machine shop courses in school at the time, so I decided to create one myself.
					I spent countless hours researching the few premade winches, as well as a couple DIY winch builds, and then went through many design iterations.
					I had all the sheet metal cut on water and laser, and contacted 
						<a href="http://www.condraulic.com" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">Condraulic</a>
					to bend the tubes for the frame.
					I machined the hubs, and frame cross tubes myself during shop classes, and then worked with my friend
						<a href="mailto:botman_alex@hotmail.com" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">Alex Bot</a>
					to weld the frame, and finish the assembly.
					<br>
					<br>
					We quickly realized, that while we had created the winch with the intention of urban skiing, we should use it in the summer as well, so we bought a wakeskate, and took the winch to the beach.
