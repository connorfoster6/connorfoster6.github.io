				I wanted to raise the quality of my video production, which is primarily action content.
				An important aspect of quality cinematography, particularly in this genre, is footage stability.
				Almost all of the camera stabilizing systems I have seen are either finnicky, or expensive, in relation to my criteria.
				The best system I had seen was the Devin Graham Glidecam, but of course that was out of budget.
				A good friend of mine,
					<a href="http://mattleyland.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">Matt Leyland</a>,
				who is a mechanical engineer, was interested in video stablization as well, so we decided to break down the best system we found, and redesign it in such a way that we could create it with the machinery we had access to.
				We took the principals of a camera gimbal and focused on the user interaction, in order to define the criteria of each part, then designed those parts for primarily profile cutting and lathe machining.
				<br>
				We then worked with another friend of mine,
				<a href="mailto:botman_alex@hotmail.com" style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">Alex Bot</a> who is a nuclear engineer to help us finish manufacturing the parts we had.
				<br>
				<br>
				We got to test it out during spring skiing, which is arguably the roughest time of the year terrain wise, and put together a short edit for Instagram.

				The stabilizer now works exactly as intended, however it's greatest downfall is that people don't understand it, so I put together another short video to explain exactly how it does, what it does.
