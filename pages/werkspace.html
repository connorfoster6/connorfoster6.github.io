				In 2016 I built a 4' x 7' standing desk, with the intention of having each side accesible, so that I could have multiple work stations set up simultaneously.

				<br>
				<br>
				This meant I would not have to clear desk space in order to change tasks.
				This worked for a time, however a desk that large requires a large room, and means you have to constantly walk around the desk.
				I wanted something with a higher degree of spacial functionality, and a smaller, more versatile footprint.
				I decided to cut my desk into two smaller desks, which I could arrange into different positions, or seperate altogether.
				The biggest challenge was creating a design that would not wobble, and did not look disgusting, considering the materials I was working with were 2x4s and plywood.

				After I finished building the desks, I discovered that it has accidental, natural storage areas in the leg structure.
				Moving forward, I need to come up with better paper organization, and a wire managment system.
