					The thing that annoys me most about using my phone, is that the keyboard is not fast or accurate enough.
					It seems that text prediction, and the technical side of soft keyboards has been advancing, while the design has remained the same.
					I think that the direction messaging is taking isn't necessarily bad, but I do believe that not having to type your responses takes away from your individuality, and requirement to consider what it is you actually want to say to someone.
					It seems to me that if your goal is faster communication, then apps like Google Allo, and prediction engines that can predict entire sentences, force you into a groove, and take away from your capacity to be original.
					You might say that the keyboard is still there for users to use, but the keyboard is exactly the same as it was 10 years ago.
					I wanted to completely rethink the layout and design of the keyboard, and give users to the ability to type fast and accurate, without sacrificing their originality and individuality.
					The only issue is, I have never written an app before, let alone a text prediction engine.
					The first step was to come up with the interaction, and keyboard layouts.
					Once I learn how to implement a functional, standard input method, the next step will be to create a prediction engine for the layout I'm using, and implement settings for left handed users, custom dictionaries and shortcuts, etc.
