				<p>I have became fed up with the state of the smartphone soft keyboard, which is to say that I have yet to type on a well implemented keyboard, with design logic anywhere close to what I want in a keyboard. I have typed on one great keyboard, granted it was a hard keyboard, but it was the fastest input method I have used, and it was accurate. Naturally I decided to create my own keyboard app, and see if I can implement something that is fast and accurate, with good text prediction.<br>
				<br>
				I have never created an app however, nor have I really done any technical work beyond this website. I started with an excursion to the library, and am currently refining the standard input. Once that is functional, the next step will be to write a text prediction engine.<br>
